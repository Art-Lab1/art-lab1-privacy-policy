    <h1>Art-Lab1 Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="meta">Application: <strong>Art-Lab1</strong> • Company: <strong>Art-Lab1</strong> • Last updated: 2025-10-21</div>
    <div class="card">
      <p>This Privacy Policy applies to <strong>Art-Lab1</strong>, a personal tool used by its owner to upload images (pins) to Pinterest via the official Pinterest API.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
    <p><strong>Art-Lab1</strong> is owned and operated by a private individual. The application is used personally and does not provide functionality for third-party users.</p>

    <h2>2. How Art-Lab1 Works</h2>
    <p>Art-Lab1 publishes content to the owner’s Pinterest account using OAuth authentication. An access token is created and stored locally on the owner’s device or in environment variables.</p>

    <h2>3. Data We Process</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Authorization data:</strong> Pinterest OAuth access token, expiration time, and target board ID — stored locally for <em>Art-Lab1</em> to function.</li>
      <li><strong>Publication content:</strong> images, descriptions, and links intentionally uploaded by the owner through Art-Lab1.</li>
      <li><strong>Operation logs:</strong> optional local logs (error messages, timestamps). These are not shared with third parties.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Art-Lab1 does <strong>not</strong> collect personal data from third-party users, does not create accounts, and does not perform behavioral analytics.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Sources</h2>
    <p>All data is provided by the owner or generated automatically through interaction with the Pinterest API.</p>

    <h2>5. Purpose and Legal Basis</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> authentication with Pinterest and content publishing initiated by the owner through Art-Lab1.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal basis:</strong> the owner’s legitimate interest in processing their own data for personal use of Art-Lab1.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Disclosure</h2>
    <p>Data is not shared with third parties except for necessary exchanges with Pinterest for content publication via API. We do not sell or rent data.</p>

    <h2>7. Storage and Security</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tokens and settings are kept locally (e.g., configuration files or environment variables) and should not be published.</li>
      <li>Access to the device and source code repository should be restricted; consider using a secrets manager.</li>
      <li>Content uploaded to Pinterest is stored and processed under Pinterest’s policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Cookies and Trackers</h2>
    <p>Art-Lab1 itself does not use cookies. When visiting external sites (such as pinterest.com), their respective cookie policies apply.</p>

    <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since Art-Lab1 is used personally and does not handle third-party data, standard data subject rights apply only to the owner’s own account and content within Pinterest.</p>

    <h2>10. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Primary third-party service: Pinterest. Use is governed by Pinterest’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Pinterest may receive technical data required to deliver and process content via their API.</p>

    <h2>11. Retention Period</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tokens and configuration: until revoked or deleted by the owner.</li>
      <li>Local logs: at the owner’s discretion (recommended to delete regularly).</li>
      <li>Pins on Pinterest: until deleted by the owner within Pinterest’s interface.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>12. Revoking Access and Deleting Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Revoke OAuth access in Pinterest developer settings or regenerate/delete the token locally.</li>
      <li>Delete published pins directly in Pinterest.</li>
      <li>Remove configuration files and logs from the local device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>13. Policy Updates</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. The latest revision date is shown at the top of the page.</p>
